# Programming Resources
List of resources for aspiring contributors related to technologies we use here at hackarmour. These resources are targetted mostly towards beginner to intermediate level programmers. These resources are separated in different categories and time taken to cover each may vary from the estimated time mentioned here.

# Introduction
We use a lot of tech in hackarmour. We are mostly a security community but this repository is mainly focused on development and programming side of things. Some of the projects or assignments may look confusing and you may not find everything here to master a particular topic so you will need to research and find the answers on your own, so cope harder. You can always reach out to us on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ePAVq2frFB)

# Programming Resources
List of resources for aspiring contributors related to technologies we use here at hackarmour. These resources are targetted mostly towards beginner to intermediate level programmers. These resources are separated in different categories and time taken to cover each may vary from the estimated time mentioned here.

# Introduction
We use a lot of tech at hackarmour. We are mostly a security community but this repository is mainly focused on development and programming side of things. Please [google](https://www.google.com) the terms you don't understand. Some of the projects or assignments may look confusing and you may not find everything here to master a particular topic so you will need to research and find the answers on your own, so cope harder. You can always reach out to us on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/ePAVq2frFB)

# Table of Contents
We are working on a search engine also make some security challenges. You may find a lot of web development stuff here, including some malware and system programming resources. This will mostly tend to start from the basics and then will move to advenced stuff.

## Basics Of Computer Science
- [CS50 by Harvard](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
  
  Will teach you basics of computational thinking, basic data structures & algorithms, programming with C, python, javascript and also a good introduction to web development. Complete the exercises and assignments of the course for some practical work
  
- [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python?utm_source=lms_catalog_service_user&utm_medium=affiliate_partner)

  This course is mostly focused towards the python programming language, including in depth knowledge of python. Python is a good programming language for beginners, but we dont recommend it usig outside data science circles. We can make some cool security challenges and tools with it tho.
  
- Projects: All the assignments given in the CS50 course should be enough.

## Web Development
This section consists of almost all the tooling and languages required to learn web development. Remember, this section isn't only about making websites, it is also about programming servers which can also power a mobile app or a multiplayer game.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) is one of the best guide as well as a great reference to all the languages and tooling required to learn web development. However this does not cover hands on exercises.

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) is a great place where you can learn by doing. I recommend this for mostly for HTML CSS and basic JavaScript.

- Web Project I - By this time you must have mastered front end development. I suggest to check out the (Stanford Web Homeworks)(https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs193x/cs193x.1176/homework/) and try to complete [TODO: analyse the homeworks peoperly]
